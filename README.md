## Instructions:    
1. Within Mattermost create the WebHook for each team you'd like to send data to.     
2. Update the JavaScript 'teams' array below to include your team name & WebHook url for each team.     
3. Update the JavaScript 'channels' array to include the channels you would like to post to.      
   Note - if channel is not found check the channel 'handle'. It is viewable within Mattermost under the Rename Channel menu option.     
4. Test the integration.
